export const about = [

  `I'm a computer science enthusiast and a student currently located in Helsinki area. ` +
  `I found great interest in programming ever since I found out about it and fell in love ` +
  `with the problem solving challenges and endless room for improvement it offers. ` +
  `The more I learn new skills the more I discover ideas and areas where I can improve ` +
  `myself, this has driven me to continuously trying to improve myself. `,

  `I started out programming when my friend introduced me to an online Java course made by the ` +
  `University of Helsinki, I have always been interested in computers and I was instantly hooked. ` +
  `I finished the course and applied to the University of Helsinki where I got the opportunity to learn even more. ` +
  `Since then I have learned many new languages including React and Python, and importantly learned the skills needed ` +
  `to adapt to new languages and skills on my own.`,

  `My goal is to keep improving myself and never stop learning about this wonderful industry. ` +
  `I feel lucky to have found a career that keeps me interested and doesn't feel like a task. ` +
  `During my studies the best experiences have been during group projects and the synergy you get by ` +
  `being part of a great team. This is unfortunately uncommon in university studies so I am looking forward ` +
  `to getting my first job and getting the opportunity to work with and learn from experienced developers.`
  ,
  'In my free time I like to focus on my hobbies which include tennis, football and other sports, ' +
  `I have found that as in programming I enjoy sports where you can improve yourself over time. ` +
  `Sports has helped me balance the unfortunate side effect of programming which is spending a lot of time in front ` +
  `of the computer.`,
